This case study was from the google data analytics capstone course. I assumed the role of a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. Using **R**, I analyzed user data specifically focused on fitness metrics collected through Fitbit fitness tracker dataset(a similarfitness company) in order to gain and translate insights into actionable marketing strategies for Bellabeat.

This case study was from the google data analytics capstone course. Cyclistic is a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success
depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships.  I used **BigQuery** to analyze the cyclistic bike share historical data from Jan-Dec 2020 to understand usage patterns and motivations of both casual riders and annual members in order to develop effective marketing strategies focused on converting casual riders into annual members. I created **visualizations** [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/amanda.egega/viz/Bikesharevisualization/bikesharestory#1)

This project was from the advanced google data analytics capstone course. The HR department at Salifort Motors wants to take some initiatives to improve employee satisfaction levels at the company and reduce employee turnover. Using **Python**, my goals were to analyze the data collected by the HR department and build a model that predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company(**Predictive Modelling**). I built regression model, decision tree model, random forest model and the xgboost model. The random forest model emerged as the champion model.
